# Object-Detection-using-Lightweight-FPN

* Implemented a Fast Pyramid Network (FPN) based object detection model.
* Focused on detecting rotated bounding boxes for star objects on synthetically generated data.
* Achieved a significant reduction in model size, making the FPN model approximately 50% lighter than the YOLO model.
* Evaluated model performance using Intersection over Union (IOU) metric, achieving an impressive score of around 0.8.
* Developed a user-friendly interface to demonstrate real-time inference on custom images.
